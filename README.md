# About
This project presents a 4-bit digital locker system implemented using gate logic. The primary goal of the project was to create a secure and efficient locking mechanism using fundamental digital logic gates. The locker utilizes a 4-bit binary code to provide secure access control. The project demonstrates the application of digital logic concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Key Features:

* Secure 4-bit digital locker system.
* tilizes basic gate logic such as AND, OR, XOR gates.
* Implements a binary code for access control.
* LED indicators for visual feedback.
* Minimalistic design for easy understanding.
